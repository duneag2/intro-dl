# Introduction to Deep Learning

- This is an introductory-level deep learning course specially designed for freshmen of DL MATH Lab @Department of Mathematics, Korea University (Advisor: [Prof. Seungsang Oh](https://sites.google.com/view/seungsangoh/home))
- It follows Prof. Oh's [Youtube Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkm0RrmnH4s&list=PLvbUC2Zh5oJvByu9KL82bswYT2IKf0K1M&pp=iAQB) and consists of various examples that help you learn basic (crucial, actually!) notions of deep learning.
- It is recommended that you complete Jupyter Notebook-based assignments every week (9 weeks in total), and for the 10th week, the goal is to participate in the data analysis competition DLMATHON (an abbreviation of 'DL MATH' + HACK'ATHON').
